    This won't be the solution you were looking for I'm sure, but it's
    functional:
    1) Take 4 x individual units of anything (can be dots it you like)
    and place them in a square formation
    2) Draw lines between each unit including the diagonals, so that
    every dot connects with another
    3) Add up all the interconnecting points of those lines and you will
    find the number = 5
