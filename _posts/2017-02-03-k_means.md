Let's say you have a bunch of data on cancer cells, and you know your data only has \(5\) types of cells. You can then run k-means with \(k=5\) to see if the raw data naturally "separates out". The idea is that if particular types of cells "cluster" in your raw data, this algorithm will try to find the regions that they cluster around. You can then break the data up into "cells", called Voronoi cells to predict whether or not a given cell is of a particular type.
<br>
With random data like I have here, the "centroids" or the centers of the voronoi cells tend to just spread themselves out.

Someday I will redo this with actual data and D3 (no offense Richard)
