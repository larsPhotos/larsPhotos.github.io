The famous Ulam Spiral. The story is that Ulam was sitting in a boring lecture doodling. He started off by listing the natural numbers in a spiral pattern and circling the prime numebrs. To his surprise, the primes seemed to lie on diagonals. It turns out that this corresponds to an interesting property of some quadratic polynomials (equations with \(x^2\) in them) which will produce a surprising number of primes. For more details see this <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeSpiral.html">mathworld page</a>, and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Prime-GeneratingPolynomial.html">this</a> one.
