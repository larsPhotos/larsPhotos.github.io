This past summer I got to work with Professor Douglas Cannon to write a [paper](http://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/summer_research/276) on John Etchemendy's book, *The Concept of Logical Consequence*.

[here](/../../../../data/logic_poster.pdf) is a poster I made for the research symposium


My research focused on Etchemendy's criticism of Tarski's model theory and the responses this prompted from other prominent logicians. One of the areas that I am interested in studying further is the connection between set theory and model theory. Tarski himself does not explicitly mention set theory in his short paper *On the Concept of Logical Consequence*, but the standard model theory taught in many logic courses is based in set theory. Gila Sher makes this problem explicit by arguing that mathematics can be treated as a basis for logic and logic can be a basis for mathematics; neither is "the" basis for the other. The idea that logic is the basis or foundation for mathematics (and vice versa) is called foundationalism, which Sher rejects. This is a relatively unusual position so Etchemendy instead focued on two views he calls *interpretational* and *representational* semantics.
